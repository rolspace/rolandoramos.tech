<p>I purchased Diablo 3 almost two years after the original release date. I bought&nbsp;it right when Blizzard was running a&nbsp;50% discount on the price, so&nbsp;at 20&euro; it was the perfect time to get back to point-and-clicking&nbsp;like it was the year 2000.</p>
<p>I was really looking forward to playing the game, but my original enthusiasm died down when I realized that I needed to pay 60&euro; in order to play an online-only game. So I decided to wait until it got cheaper.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-558" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.rolspace.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;diablo1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" &#47;></p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-480"></a></p>
<p>Let's start with the things I did not like.&nbsp;There were two specific aspects of the game&nbsp;where I was very disappointed&nbsp;with the decisions made by Blizzard.</p>
<p><strong>[SPOILERS AHEAD]<&#47;strong></p>
<p>Like the story...it is bad, very bad. The way the story was presented throughout the game felt rushed and everything related to it seemed&nbsp;out of place. Especially in regards to Leah...she never really developed as a character in the story, which would have been helpful, considering how central she is to everything.</p>
<p>Not everything is a let down, Cain's exit is a nice moment, as well as Diablo's arrival to Heaven. However, both the heroes and the villains in this game seem like a group of squabbling children instead of characters that are deciding the fate of humans, angels, and demons. There is no real sense of being part of an epic quest.</p>
<p>The decision to have an always-online&nbsp;single player campaign is questionable. For anyone that enjoys going through the campaign solo (me!) this decision has no benefits. While I can understand the desire to prevent piracy, or to stop cheating players in the PvE online modes, in the end this requirement hurts paying customers.</p>
<p>I can only imagine the rage that could come from losing a character in hardcore mode because of a dropped connection.</p>
<p>I believe there's no reason for a solo campaign to be tied to your online connection, even more so after seeing that the console versions of the game do not have&nbsp;this limitation.</p>
<p>The good thing about these flaws is that the can be largely ignored and they do not detract from the gameplay. I have never suffered from lag issues while connected to Battle.net and after some time it is easy to ignore the dialogue between characters.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-559" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.rolspace.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;diablo2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" &#47;></p>
<p>On the good side, I really&nbsp;enjoyed the rest of&nbsp;Diablo 3, especially its&nbsp;combat mechanics. I completed the campaign with two different classes (Monk and Wizard) and the skills available for both were&nbsp;quite varied.</p>
<p>This diversity encourages&nbsp;the player to test&nbsp;their acquired skills in order to determine&nbsp;which are the best for their&nbsp;playing style.&nbsp;The cooldowns for both skills and health potions are a welcome addition, as well as the need to monitor&nbsp;the status of the energy meter while in combat.</p>
<p>After finishing the campaign twice with two different characters, I can safely write that truly believe that Diablo 3 is a great game on its own merit, even though its predecessor's shadow looms large over it. True,&nbsp;Diablo 3 is not perfect, but it is without a doubt&nbsp;an entertaining game.</p>
<p>I do not feel that it provides the same lasting appeal as Diablo 2, but that's ok. I &nbsp;had a lot fun going back to Sanctuary after such a long time, and I will probably return for a third playthrough. And if you have not, then you should.</p>
