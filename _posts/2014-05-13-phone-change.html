<p>Four and a half years and <em>three Android phones<&#47;em>&nbsp;later I felt it was time to give Windows Phone a chance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-661" style="border-radius: 0px;" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.rolspace.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2014&#47;05&#47;windowsphone-e1434052735872.png" alt="" width="320" height="477" &#47;></p>
<p>I admit that some of the recent Android devices made me really consider&nbsp;the idea of changing ecosystems, especially the <em>Nexus 5.&nbsp;<&#47;em>I had previously owned a <em>Nexus S<&#47;em> and I still consider it the best smartphone I have ever owned.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-38"></a></p>
<p>However, that was not enough to make me stay with Android, though I needed to get a new phone as soon as possible because my <em>HTC One S<&#47;em> was falling apart</p>
<p>For me, the Android environment had become stale and I was not looking forward to shelling out money for the same type of device.</p>
<p>One of the key factors for this&nbsp;change was the fact that most of the Windows Phone users I knew were .NET developers, like myself.</p>
<p>I had worked with some of them in the past and I valued their opinion, as I knew they would be honest in their evaluations. Their comments regarding the OS were quite favorable and everyone seemed to be pretty happy with their devices.</p>
<p>Another point in favor of Windows Phone and Windows in general, is that it appears Microsoft is doing some really nice things in order to bring the desktop&#47;tablet&#47;mobile environments together in terms of development.</p>
<p>Once the decision was made I ended up choosing the <em>Nokia Lumia 925<&#47;em>. I have spent about 3 weeks with it and I have to say that so far I am really happy with the decision. I really like the build quality of the phone, battery life is great for my needs, and I am quite impressed with the OS.</p>
<p>While it is true that the app ecosystem pales in comparison to the App Store and the Play Market I really have no complaints about finding the apps I need, except for a decent <em>Hangouts&#47;GTalk<&#47;em> app. I am really looking forward to install the <em>Windows Phone 8.1<&#47;em> update, as it appears that the are quite a few improvements to the OS.</p>
<p>Even though it was OK to be dismissive of Microsoft's mobile efforts in the past, I believe that for some time now they have been going in the right direction and I am glad I decided to make the change now. Not just from a user standpoint, but from a developer's perspective as well.</p>
<p>It really looks like Microsoft wants to become a serious contender in the smartphone market and this can only mean they will keep on adding features to improve the experience.</p>
<p>If you can, you might want to give Windows Phone a try.</p>
