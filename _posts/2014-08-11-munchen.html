<p>My stay in Munich was a too&nbsp;short, even so, the fact is that M&uuml;nich is a GREAT&nbsp;place to visit.&nbsp;The weather was right, the food was tasty, and the beer was cold.</p>
<p>The one place I liked the most after visiting Munich&nbsp;is definitely&nbsp;<em>Viktualienmarkt.<&#47;em>&nbsp;The&nbsp;market is a great place to sit down,&nbsp;have a beer, and spend some time just being there, especially on a sunny day.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-103"></a></p>
<p>Having said that, I am glad it rained during one of the afternoons I was there, or else I would&nbsp;not&nbsp;have had the chance to check out the <em>Lenbachhaus<&#47;em>.&nbsp;There is some really good artwork there and you can easily spend 2-3 hours going through the museum.</p>
<p>And DO NOT miss the views from St. Peter&acute;s. Be warned though, the walk up the tower takes a bit of time, and it might be a bit cramped.</p>
<p>I am definitely going back to Munich at some point in the future.</p>
