<p>It's been about three months since my first class. I was not really sure what to expect, since the general opinion is that German is a really tough language to learn.</p>
<p>At this point&nbsp;I can proudly say that I have learned a few things and I am probably able&nbsp;to say a phrase or two. I can pick up the meaning of a few advertisement&nbsp;posters in the street, and I can&nbsp;figure out the meaning of a few newspaper headlines.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-204"></a>The big trouble comes when trying to listen to German out in the street (especially so in Zurich), that's tough, so "<em>Ich brauche mehr zuh&ouml;ren"<&#47;em>&nbsp;I guess.</p>
<p>Learning is always an fun activity, though learning a new language isn't easy. The main problem is finding time to practice and learn new words. &nbsp;Where did all the time I used to have go? :S</p>
<p>Sooner or later I will need to find a conversation group or something similar. My class&nbsp;is pretty good and I am learning a lot, but without practice it will be difficult to make any significant strides.Though so far so gut.</p>
