<p class="subtitle">Admin Command Prompt for Windows 8 in the context menu</p>

I can't believe I have gone so long without using something like this in my Windows OS. This blog post from Michael Crump tells you everything you need to know.

Using this registry edit, you can open a Command Prompt with Admin privileges from any folder by right-clicking on the File Explorer. This creates a handy shortcut that can be launched anywhere in the File Explorer.

<p class="subtitle">VSCommands for Visual Studio</p>

A colleague of mine told me about this Visual Studio extension some time ago. It provides some very useful features and tools to enhance your Visual Studio productivity.

My three favorite commands from this extension are:

+ *Attach to IIS*: displays a dialog window in Visual Studio with the available IIS websites you can attach your code to.

+ *Locate in Solution Explorer*: shows the location of a file in the editor on the Solution Explorer.

+ *Locate in TFS*: finds the location of a file in the editor (or the Solution Explorer) on the Source Control Explorer.

<p class="subtitle">Node School</p>

I have become quite interested in Node in the past few months. So, when I finally decided to really get into it, the first thing I did was to go to [http://nodeschool.io][NodeSchool] and check out which tutorials I could find to get started.

A few days ago I completed the learnyounode tutorial, which I thoroughly enjoyed and gave me a pretty good start into the Node world. I strongly recommend it, you can find it here: [https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode][LearnYouNode].

While completing the learnyounode exercises I came across this GitHub repo: [https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node][ArtOfNode]

I do not remember how I found this link while I was doing the tutorial. Nevertheless, the information presented in the document provides some good background details about the core Node concepts.

This is extremely helpful if you are getting started with Node. It is definitely worth a read. Also, the author provides some additional resources to continue your Node learning.
