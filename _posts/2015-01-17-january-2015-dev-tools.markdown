<p class="subtitle">Admin Command Prompt for Windows 8 in the context menu</p>

[http://michaelcrump.net/power-tip-elevated-command-prompt-here-in-windows-8-1][CommandPrompt]

I can't believe I have gone so long without using something like this in my Windows OS. This blog post from Michael Crump tells you everything you need to know.

Using this registry edit, you can open a Command Prompt with Admin privileges from any folder by right-clicking on the File Explorer. This creates a handy shortcut that can be launched anywhere in the File Explorer.

<p class="subtitle">VSCommands for Visual Studio</p>

[http://vscommands.squaredinfinity.com][VSCommands]

A colleague of mine told me about this Visual Studio extension some time ago. It provides some very useful features and tools to enhance your Visual Studio productivity.

My three favorite commands from this extension are:

+ *Attach to IIS*: displays a dialog window in Visual Studio with the available IIS websites you can attach your code to.

+ *Locate in Solution Explorer*: shows the location of a file in the editor on the Solution Explorer.

+ *Locate in TFS*: finds the location of a file in the editor (or the Solution Explorer) on the Source Control Explorer.

In the past few months I have become quite interested in Node. One of the first things I did was to visit [http://nodeschool.io][NodeSchool] and check out which tutorials I could use to get started.

One of the tutorials I came across was *learnyounode*. I completed all the exercises recently and I have to say I really liked how it is set up as a learning tool. In a few short sessions you can a get good overview of how Node works.

Also, while completing the exercises I came across this GitHub repo: [https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node][ArtOfNode]

I do not remember how I found this link while I was doing the tutorial. Nevertheless, the information presented in the document provides some good background details about the core Node concepts.

This is a very good resource if you are getting started with Node. It is definitely worth a read, as you can find additional resources to continue your Node learning.
