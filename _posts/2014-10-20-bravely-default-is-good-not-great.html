<p>This game was on my radar for a quite a while. Initially, it was&nbsp;released only in Japan, but there were many gaming websites with information about the game&nbsp;(story, characters, features, etc).</p>
<p>The general feeling I got from reading all the information&nbsp;available&nbsp;was that the game was pretty&nbsp;great, even though it had a few minor flaws. The way people were writing about it, it felt like&nbsp;Bravely Default was the&nbsp;next <em>Great RPG<&#47;em>.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-202"></a>The game was finally announced for release in the west, and I decided that I would buy it on day one (note: I very rarely&nbsp;do this). I felt that if I was going to use my limited gaming time on a 40+ hour RPG, it had&nbsp;to be this game.</p>
<p>Not too long ago I finished the game, and I feel...relieved. It was definitely a good game, but I think it has one major flaw that is very hard to overlook. So let's start with the good things.</p>
<p>The battle system in Bravely Default is somewhat different from your typical turn based RPG. During a turn, the player can select to either <em>Brave<&#47;em> or <em>Default<&#47;em> for a character in the battle. If you select Brave you use BP (battle points) and the character will unleash multiple attacks (max 4) on the enemy. If you select Default, then the character will store 1 BP for the next turn and defend from any enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Joining this feature with the&nbsp;abilities provided by the game's job system, gives players the option&nbsp;to use different approaches in&nbsp;enemy encounters. The jobs available in the game are quite diverse&nbsp;and most of them have at least one&nbsp;skill&nbsp;that can be helful&nbsp;in a character's abilities setup.</p>
<p>One of the best things about Bravely Default is the soundtrack.&nbsp;I never got tired of hearing the music in this game, I definitely need to get my hands on the soundtrack at some point. Even if you don't enjoy the game that much, the music will keep you in it.</p>
<p>For the most part I feel that the design and graphics&nbsp;were the right style choice for the game. The one minor complaint I have here is that it was a bit strange to see the characters wearing the job costumes during cutscenes. The 3D effect works really well in Bravely Default, never turn it off.</p>
<p>And finally, the one I believe is the best feature in the game: the ability to increase&#47;decrease the game's difficulty and&#47;or to turn off enemy encounters. This is extremely useful, especially for older gamers like myself. Now that I have used this, it will be very hard to play an RPG without something similar, for me, it changes the whole experience. Random encounters are the devil!</p>
<p>Now, onto the bad things...</p>
<p><strong>[SPOILERS AHEAD]<&#47;strong></p>
<p>The game has a huge pacing problem. Everything seems fine until you reach a specific point in the story, and then, it seems like you got your own Norende sized hole to deal with.</p>
<p>After finally beating the game I could not help but wonder why this decision was made. Why would the people who made the game decide that you had to repeat a specific section of the game four times (was it four or five?). In fact, that's not really the problem. The problem is that the repetition is boring. For me, it almost killed the game.</p>
<p>By Chapter 6 I was saying to myself: <strong>"This has got to be the last time, right? Right??"<&#47;strong> And then there were <em>two<&#47;em> more go-rounds.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this game&nbsp;is&nbsp;not going to&nbsp;win any RPG of the Decade awards, and one specific design choice turned&nbsp;what had been&nbsp;really fun game into a hassle I am not planning to repeat. I'm glad it's over.</p>
<p><strong>[END SPOILERS]<&#47;strong></p>
<p>In the end, Bravely Default does a lot of things right, and it is one of the best games available for the 3DS. I say that if you have time to spare, then go ahead and play it, especially now that it should be a bit&nbsp;cheaper. It has one glaring flaw that drags&nbsp;down&nbsp;the last part of the game, but as a whole, Bravely Default&nbsp;is a good gaming experience.</p>
