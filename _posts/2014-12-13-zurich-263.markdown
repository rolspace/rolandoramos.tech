<p>Our first winter in Zurich is almost here.&nbsp;Little by little the clouds have taken over and temperature has been dropping gradually&nbsp;in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>September and October were quite&nbsp;good in terms of temperature and sunshine. Unlike August, which was the&nbsp;anti-Summer: lots of cloudy days and&nbsp;lots of rain.<br />

<p>Things have clearly changed in December, where we've had a few days with near 0 degree temperatures, or less. There has been no snow yet, but hopefully some will fall when winter gets going for good.</p>
<p>At the beginning of November, I had a chance to go up to the Uetliberg's summit on a Sunday afternoon without the need to wear a heavy jacket. It's great that only a 30 minute hike takes you all the way to the top, and you get a great view of the city. Thanks to the good weather there were tons of people around and enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>I'll be coming back here many more times I hope.</p>
