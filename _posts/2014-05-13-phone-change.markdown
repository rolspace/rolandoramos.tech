Four and a half years and <em>three Android phones</em> later I felt it was time to give Windows Phone a chance.

I admit that some of the recent Android devices made me really consider the idea of changing ecosystems, especially the <em>Nexus 5. </em>I had previously owned a <em>Nexus S</em> and I still consider it the best smartphone I have ever owned.

However, that was not enough to make me stay with Android, though I needed to get a new phone as soon as possible because my <em>HTC One S</em> was falling apart

For me, the Android environment had become stale and I was not looking forward to shelling out money for the same type of device.

One of the key factors for this change was the fact that most of the Windows Phone users I knew were .NET developers, like myself.

I had worked with some of them in the past and I valued their opinion, as I knew they would be honest in their evaluations. Their comments regarding the OS were quite favorable and everyone seemed to be pretty happy with their devices.

Another point in favor of Windows Phone and Windows in general, is that it appears Microsoft is doing some really nice things in order to bring the desktop/tablet/mobile environments together in terms of development.

Once the decision was made I ended up choosing the <em>Nokia Lumia 925</em>. I have spent about 3 weeks with it and I have to say that so far I am really happy with the decision. I really like the build quality of the phone, battery life is great for my needs, and I am quite impressed with the OS.

While it is true that the app ecosystem pales in comparison to the App Store and the Play Market I really have no complaints about finding the apps I need, except for a decent <em>Hangouts/GTalk</em> app. I am really looking forward to install the <em>Windows Phone 8.1</em> update, as it appears that the are quite a few improvements to the OS.

Even though it was OK to be dismissive of Microsoft's mobile efforts in the past, I believe that for some time now they have been going in the right direction and I am glad I decided to make the change now. Not just from a user standpoint, but from a developer's perspective as well.

It really looks like Microsoft wants to become a serious contender in the smartphone market and this can only mean they will keep on adding features to improve the experience.

If you can, you might want to give Windows Phone a try.
