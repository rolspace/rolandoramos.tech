One of the most difficult things I have had to do during my time as a manager is to hire people.

As I soon found out, there has been a lot written about the topic of hiring and the reasons why it is a hard. Many people who become managers (like me) are totally unprepared to go through the process of identifying and hiring the best candidates for a position.

I used to think that for Software Engineering things were a lot easier, considering that you can always gauge someone's technical ability through an assessment or a coding test. Now, my opinion is very different, but we will get to that in a few minutes.

I spent time reading many different articles and having multiple conversations with colleagues and friends, I came to the conclusion that hiring Software Engineers is difficult because:

- There isn't a clear definition of the qualities and skills needed.
- There isn't a "right" way to determine technical ability.

These are not the only factors that make hiring Software Engineers challenging, but in my experience, these are two of the most important reasons that make this process particularly challenging.

No clear definition of the qualities and skills needed

When it comes to writing a job description for a new job opening, things can get complicated quickly. In an ideal scenario, a good job description should contain a listing of the core skills needed to be valuable member of an organization.

The reality is...different. You can browse job ads in various online platforms and good descriptions are hard to find.

Instead, it is easy to find offers that describe positions where "adequate" candidates should know multiple programming languages and be knowledgeable about various tools and online services in order to be considered. You normally see these types of job opportunities accompanied by words like rockstar, ninja or awesome.

I understand there is a need to "sell" a position to find good candidates, but isn't this a sure way to discourage good candidates from showing interest? I think it is. Of course, there are situations where highly skilled people are in demand and job offers like these are needed.

My personal recommendation is that hiring managers should be as clear as possible about the technical skills and the day to day responsibilities required for a new role. This information should remain consistent throughout the hiring process. It will be hard to recover a candidate's trust, if different people in your organization provide different explanations about the job and its responsibilities,  

No "right" way to determine technical ability

In order to hire Software Engineers, it becomes necessary to determine their technical ability. This normally happens through technical interviews or challenges that the candidate needs to complete. This technical evaluations come in different forms:

- Whiteboard testing
- In person assignments
- Take home assignments
- Technical discussions

In my experience, the level of detail and difficulty needed to "pass" technical interviews has been different each time. On those occasions where I was successful and I was hired for a position, the technical challenge had little to do with the actual tasks that I would later need to complete.

I generally agree with Joel Spolsky's statement: candidates interviewing for engineering roles should write code during an interview. However, I think that in our quest to find the best talent available our industry took a wrong turn.

The context of a job interview isnt the right place to ask a candidate to try to solve a very specific problem using a specific language. I believe that we should focus instead on determining how well a candidate understands problems and the steps they use to reach a solution using software development principles.

Should they write code? Ideally yes, but this should be in the form of pseudocode or a diagram, in order to evaluate the candidate's thought process in reaching a solution. A technical interview is already a tense environment, where the candidate needs to prove their expertise and skills to people whom they have never worked with. As someone in charge of hiring, it is your responsibility to make the technical interview a place where the candidate feels comfortable and they have an open discussion with an equal.

If we are able to improve the interview process, it will be for everyone's gain. Candidates for Software Engineering roles should be aware of what will be expected from them and their technical ability should be assessed in a way...
