One of the most difficult things I have had to do during my time as a team manager is to hire people.

There has been a lot written about the topic of hiring and the reasons why it is a hard. I've come to realize that quite a few people who become managers, like me, are totally unprepared to go through the process of identifying and hiring the best candidates.

I used to think that hiring Software Engineers would be easier, considering that you can always measure someone's technical ability through an assessment or a coding test. Now, my opinion has changed a little, but we will get to that in a bit.

Soon after I was promoted, I spent a lot of time reading many articles about recruitment and I had a few conversations with colleagues and friends on this topic. After all this time, I have come to the conclusion that hiring Software Engineers is difficult because:

- There is no clear definition of the skills needed for a role.
- There is no standard method to determine technical ability.

I am not saying that these are the only factors that make hiring Software Engineers a challenge. What I am saying is, that these are the top two reasons why this happens. Let me explain...

<p class="subtitle">There is no clear definition of the skills needed for a role</p>

When writing a job description for a new job opening, things can get complicated quickly. In an ideal scenario, a good job description should contain a listing of the core skills needed to be a valuable member of a team.

The reality is...different. You can browse job ads in various online platforms and good descriptions are hard to find.

Instead, it is easy to find job offers that describe positions where adequate candidates should be familiar with multiple programming languages and have knowledge about various tools and online services in order to be considered. You normally see these types of job opportunities accompanied by words like rockstar, ninja or awesome.

I understand there is a need to "sell" a new role to attract candidates, but isn't this a sure way to discourage perfectly adequate candidates from showing interest? I think it is.

My personal recommendation is that hiring managers should be as clear as possible about the technical skills and the day to day responsibilities required for a new role. This information should remain consistent throughout the hiring process.

If managers can provide candidates with the right expectations and the responsibilities of the role they have applied for, it makes the process much more transparent. People looking for new opportunities will, at the very least, appreciate this.

<p class="subtitle">There is no standard method to determine technical ability</p>

In order to hire Software Engineers, it is necessary to measure, as much as possible, their technical ability. This normally happens using technical interviews or challenges that the candidates need to complete. These technical evaluations take different forms:

- Whiteboard tests
- Onsite assessments
- Take home projects
- Technical questionnaires

In my experience, using these methods to test a candidate do not simplify the task of making an informed choice on whether to hire the candidate or not.

I wholeheartedly agree with Joel Spolsky's statement: candidates interviewing for engineering roles should write code during an interview. However, I think that in our quest to find the best talent available our industry took a wrong turn.

A coding or technical exercise does not need to take multiple days for you to be able to evaluate a candidate's skills. In the same vein, answering trivia questions or knowing obscure language behaviors aren't necessarily going to tell you if someone is good at understanding and solving Software Engineeering problems.

I believe that a technical evaluation needs to happen within the context of an interview, not as a take home assignment or project. It doesn't matter if the interview is onsite or remote, technology has advanced enough that this should not be a concern anymore.

One thing which is quite important, is making sure the right kind of technical problem is selected to evaluate the candidate. The idea here is not to give someone a problem and simply look at them while they try to work out the solution. Software Engineering is about talking as much as it is about programming.  

Should the candidates write code? YES! However, this should be not be constrained to a specific language, in this way it is easier to evaluate the candidate's thought process, as opposed to knowing specific syntax. A technical interview is already a tense environment, where the candidate needs to prove their expertise and skills to people whom they have never worked with. As someone in charge of hiring, it is your responsibility to make the technical interview a place where the candidate feels comfortable.

If we are able to improve the interview process, it will be everyone's gain. Candidates interviewing for Software Engineering roles should have a clear understanding of what will be expected from them. They should have as much of a guarantee as possible that their technical ability will be assessed in a way that is fair.
