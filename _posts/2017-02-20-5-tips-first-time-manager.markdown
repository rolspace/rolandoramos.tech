It has been almost a year and six months since I became a team manager for the first time in my career. I have to admit this is something I always wanted to do, but once it happened I realized that there were many things I did not know...far more than I had expected. I needed to approach this a lot differently from my previous position as Technical Lead.

For me, this has been an extremely rewarding experience, and I am painfully aware that I have made a few mistakes since then. Nevertheless, it is true that the path to improvement lies in looking back and recognizing those areas where you can adjust.

I know I do not have a lot of experience yet, but I think I can share a few of the things that have helped me ease the transition from software engineer to team manager. In no particular order:

<p class="subtitle-large">1. Listening</p>

Such a simple concept, yet it is very easy to underestimate the value of listening. No matter the years of experience or how eloquent someone is, it is important to truly listen to others' opinions and concerns. There is no easier way to get to know a person. There is no easier way for people to trust each other.

By encouraging people to voice their opinions and listening to them, it will become a habit within the team as time passes. When new people join the team, seeing this behavior will allow them to feel at ease much quicker in a new environment. They will know they have come to a place where others will listen.

<p class="subtitle-large">2. Reading and learning</p>

There is a vast amount of information on the topics of management, organization, and leadership. It would be a waste not to take advantage and use it to be the best manager you can.

Of course, not everything you read will apply to your situation. Try to identify which pieces of advice will give you the best return for your team. If you are a new manager, there are some of the aspects of a manager's role that you will be unprepared for: going through performance reviews, how to motivate others, dealing with salary negotiations, speaking to an underachieving team member, etc. It will be better to find  first-hard experiences from others who have been in a similar situation.

There are many sources to look for insight and opinions, some of my current favorites are: [The HBR][The Hardvard Business Review], [LinkedIn][LinkedIn], and [Medium][Medium].

<p class="subtitle-large">3. Setting expectations and goals</p>

The team and every person in it should know from you what is expected of it and what its goals are.

Most people know that everyone should be treated with respect, they should be on time, etc, but establishing these expectations verbally (and in writing) will drive everyone's commitment in meeting these expectations.

In the same way, when you setup short-term and long-term goals, the rest of the team will recognize that you are invested in guiding the team to achieve these goals. These goals need to be defined for the team as a whole and for individual team members.

These goals need to be challenging, but they also need to be attainable. It is important that you can support the people in your team as a coach and mentor. Your team members will need help from you to find the time and motivation to achieve these goals.

<p class="subtitle-large">4. Maximizing the strenghts of the team</p>

If you are able to recognize your teammates strenghts, then you will be better equipped to help them become more valuable to the team. By devising a plan to build upon their best qualities, you are recognizing that personÂ´s skills and giving them the opportunity to contribute in the best way they can.

Nevertheless, it is important to avoid letting team members stay too long in their comfort zone, there need to be challenges for them to hone their skills and test their limits.

<p class="subtitle-large">5. Not being afraid of weaknesses</p>

Even your own. It is crucial to recognize that we all have skills and abilities which we haven't fully developed, either through lack of training or adequate opportunities. These are great opportunities for personal improvement.

Aim to have an open conversation with each team member to determine if they feel the same way about these opportunities you have identified. It is likely that they have a different opinion about themselves.

As you discuss these chances for improvement, you will come to an understanding, together, about what should be done to take advantage of these opportunities. Doing this will help everyone in the team tackle difficult issues with more confidence.
