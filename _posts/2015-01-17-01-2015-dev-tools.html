<p>Recently,&nbsp;I came across some useful development tools, maybe they'll help you as well.</p>
<h4><i class="icon-caret-right"><&#47;i>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Admin Command Prompt in Windows<&#47;span><&#47;h4><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-573" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.rolspace.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;cmdpromptfolder.png" alt="" width="548" height="255" &#47;></p>
<p>I can't believe I have gone so long without using something like this in my Windows OS. This blog post from Michael Crump tells you everything you need to know.</p>
<p>Using this registry edit, you can open a Command Prompt with Admin privileges from any folder by right-clicking on the File Explorer. This creates a handy shortcut that can be launched anywhere in the File Explorer.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-453"></a></p>

<h4><i class="icon-caret-right"><&#47;i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;VSCommands for Visual Studio<&#47;span><&#47;h4><br />
A colleague of mine told me about this Visual Studio extension some time ago. It provides some very useful features and tools to enhance your Visual Studio productivity.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-492 size-full" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.rolspace.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;vscommandlocate.png" alt="VS Commands" width="352" height="286" &#47;></p>
<p>My three favorite&nbsp;commands from this extension are:</p>
<p><em>&ndash; Attach to IIS<&#47;em>: displays a dialog window in Visual Studio with the available IIS websites you can attach your code to.</p>
<p><em>&ndash; Locate in Solution Explorer<&#47;em>: shows&nbsp;the location of a file in the editor on the Solution Explorer.</p>
<p><em>&ndash; Locate in TFS<&#47;em>: finds the location of a file in&nbsp;the editor (or the Solution Explorer) on the Source Control Explorer.</p>
<p>You can read more about this extension here: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;vscommands.squaredinfinity.com&#47;" target="_blank">http:&#47;&#47;vscommands.squaredinfinity.com&#47;<&#47;a></p>

<h4><i class="icon-caret-right"><&#47;i>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Node&nbsp;School<&#47;span><&#47;h4><br />
I have become quite interested in Node in the past few months. So, when I finally decided to really get into it, the&nbsp;first thing I did was to go to&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;nodeschool.io&#47;">nodeschool.io<&#47;a>&nbsp;and check out which tutorials I could find&nbsp;to get started.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-495 size-full" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.rolspace.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2015&#47;01&#47;learnyounode1.png" alt="learnyounode" width="565" height="279" &#47;></p>
<p>A few days ago I completed the <em>learnyounode <&#47;em>tutorial, which I thoroughly enjoyed and gave me a pretty good start into the Node world. I strongly recommend it, you can find it&nbsp;here:</p>
<p><a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;rvagg&#47;learnyounode">https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;rvagg&#47;learnyounode<&#47;a></p>
<p>While completing the <em>learnyounode<&#47;em>&nbsp;exercises&nbsp;I came across this GitHub repo:</p>
<p><a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;maxogden&#47;art-of-node">https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;maxogden&#47;art-of-node<&#47;a></p>
<p>I do not remember how I found this link while I was doing the tutorial. Nevertheless,&nbsp;the information presented in the document provides some good background details&nbsp;about the core Node concepts.</p>
<p>This extremely helpful if you are trying to become more familiar with Node.js. It is definitely worth a read. Also, the author provides some additional resources to continue your Node learning, which is always welcome.</p>
