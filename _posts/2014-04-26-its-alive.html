<p>Finally! The first post in my blog is written. This project has gone through some rough times in the past year, to the point that it was almost left for dead a couple of times.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-361" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.rolspace.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2014&#47;04&#47;logo.png" alt="Rolspace" width="661" height="262" &#47;></p>
<p>Fortunately, things are moving in the right direction and I believe that the initial version of the website will be released in about a month (<em>or two<&#47;em>).<a id="more"></a><a id="more-29"></a></p>
<p>So, this is not the first <em>official<&#47;em> post of the website, since I am the only one able to see it. There are a lot of style changes&nbsp;that need to be made before I can officially release the website, but I feel that writing this post is a good way to get things closer to the finish line. Just a little more to go!</p>
