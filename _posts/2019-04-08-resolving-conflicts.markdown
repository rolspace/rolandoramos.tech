No, this post is not about resolving Git conflicts.

This post is about resolving people conflicts.

I will not claim to be an expert on the subject, nor will I say that I have suddenly discovered the perfect way to deal with these situations.

I have been fortunate to work with different teams throughout my career, even as a remote collaborator, and during the past three and a half years I have the opportunity to manage a team. I say fortunate because I have learned a lot from the many different people I have worked with over the years.

As you take care part in projects with tight deadlines and complex requirements, conflicts and tense situations can arise, which can delay delivery times, or even worse, cripple team dynamics. It takes strong leadership and experience to be able to keep these situations from affecting a team and hurting its productivity.
