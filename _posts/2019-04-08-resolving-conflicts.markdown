No, this post is not about resolving Git conflicts.

This post is about resolving people conflicts.

I will not claim to be an expert on the subject, nor will I say that I have suddenly discovered the perfect way to deal with these situations.

I have been fortunate to work with different teams throughout the years, even as a remote collaborator, and during the past three and a half years I have the opportunity to manage people.
