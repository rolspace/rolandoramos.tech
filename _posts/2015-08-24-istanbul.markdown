I am definitely returning to Istanbul, hopefully the wait will not be too long. If you haven't visited Istanbul yet, then you must go. It might be overrun with tourists, but there's a reason for it. I took this shot on my last night there as we were returning to our hotel. It really is a unique place.

**Edit March 25, 2017**: Things are not the same now as they were when I wrote this. I sincerely hope that Istanbul goes back to being a safe place for everyone.
