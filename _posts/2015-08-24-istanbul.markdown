I am definitely returning to Istanbul, hopefully the wait will not be too long. If you haven't visited Istanbul yet, then you must go. It might be overrun with tourists, but there's a reason for it. I took this shot on my last night there as we were returning to our hotel. It really is a unique place.

**Edit March 25, 2017**: Things have changed since the time I wrote this post. I sincerely hope that Istanbul and all of Turkey goes back to being a safe place for everyone.
