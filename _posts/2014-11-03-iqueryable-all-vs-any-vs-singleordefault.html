<p>A few days ago, I came across some code that was throwing&nbsp;a Timeout Exception&nbsp;on&nbsp;an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if<&#47;span> statement with a condition being evaluated by the <em>IQueryable.All()<&#47;em>&nbsp;method.</p>
<p>The condition being tested was pretty straightforward, the code just needed to determine&nbsp;if the value of a variable matched with an existing ID in the SQL Server database.</p>
<p>The code was&nbsp;similar to this:</p>
<pre class="lang:c# decode:true">&#47;&#47;Assume we have a table in the database called Customer<br />
&#47;&#47;with approx. 200.000 records.</p>
<p>&#47;&#47;Determine if ALL the records in the table have a<br />
&#47;&#47;CustomerID that is not equal to the value of the variable<br />
if (context.Customer.All(c => c.CustomerID != customerId))<br />
{<br />
   &#47;&#47;Execute code...<br />
}<&#47;pre><br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-224"></a>The Exception was being when executing&nbsp;the <em>worst case scenario<&#47;em> for this condition, that is, there were no values in the database that matched the variable being tested. Thus, the query had to evaluate all the records in the table.</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;this was the cause of the timeout, it seemed like a good option&nbsp;to change the condition in order to use the <em>IQueryable.Any()<&#47;em> method.</p>
<p>The statement had to be rewritten in a way that the condition would match the logic of the previous statement in order to produce the same result:</p>
<pre class="lang:c# decode:true">&#47;&#47;Determine if ANY of the records in the table have a<br />
&#47;&#47;CustomerID that is equal to the value of the variable<br />
if (!context.Customer.Any(c => c.CustomerID == customerId))<br />
{<br />
   &#47;&#47;Execute code...<br />
}<&#47;pre><br />
The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if<&#47;span>&nbsp;statement&nbsp;could be rewritten in such a way that the <em>IQueryable.SingleOrDefault() <&#47;em>method could be used instead:</p>
<pre class="lang:c# decode:true">&#47;&#47;Determine if there is a&nbsp;record in the Customer table that has a CustomerID<br />
&#47;&#47;that is equal to the customerId variable?<br />
if (context.Customer.FirstOrDefault(c => c.CustomerID == customerId) == null)<br />
{<br />
   &#47;&#47;Execute code...<br />
}<&#47;pre><br />
<strong>So which is the right method to use?<&#47;strong> Using <em>IQueryable.Any()<&#47;em> or <em>IQueryable.SingleOrDefault()<&#47;em> made the Exceptions go away. However, the best way to find out is the best approach is to measure&nbsp;the execution time for the SQL queries generated through these <em>IQueryable<&#47;em> methods.</p>
<p>To do this, I wrote&nbsp;a small program that would execute each method&nbsp;a total of 1.000 times and log the results using a custom class inheriting from the&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;msdn.microsoft.com&#47;en-us&#47;library&#47;system.data.entity.infrastructure.interception.databaselogformatter(v=vs.113).aspx" target="_blank">DatabaseLogFormatter<&#47;a> class. This way I could obtain information about the average execution time of these methods.</p>
<p>The test table in the database contains approximately 200.000 records. Both the database and the executable are in the same machine.</p>
<p>In the first run, I executed&nbsp;the&nbsp;program assuming that there is no match in the table:</p>
<div class="table-responsive">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;No Match<&#47;th></p>
<th>SingleOrDefault()<&#47;th></p>
<th>Any()<&#47;th></p>
<th>All()<&#47;th><br />
<&#47;tr><br />
<&#47;thead></p>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Average (ms)<&#47;td></p>
<td>6.25<&#47;td></p>
<td>5.45<&#47;td></p>
<td>25.37<&#47;td><br />
<&#47;tr></p>
<tr>
<td>Minimum (ms)<&#47;td></p>
<td>6<&#47;td></p>
<td>5<&#47;td></p>
<td>23<&#47;td><br />
<&#47;tr></p>
<tr>
<td>Maximum (ms)<&#47;td></p>
<td>13<&#47;td></p>
<td>8<&#47;td></p>
<td>32<&#47;td><br />
<&#47;tr><br />
<&#47;tbody><br />
<&#47;table><br />
<&#47;div><br />
In the second run, I executed the program assuming that there is a match in the table:</p>
<div class="table-responsive">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;Match<&#47;th></p>
<th>SingleOrDefault()<&#47;th></p>
<th>Any()<&#47;th></p>
<th>All()<&#47;th><br />
<&#47;tr><br />
<&#47;thead></p>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Average (ms)<&#47;td></p>
<td>6.21<&#47;td></p>
<td>5.49<&#47;td></p>
<td>14.90<&#47;td><br />
<&#47;tr></p>
<tr>
<td>Minimum (ms)<&#47;td></p>
<td>6<&#47;td></p>
<td>5<&#47;td></p>
<td>14<&#47;td><br />
<&#47;tr></p>
<tr>
<td>Maximum (ms)<&#47;td></p>
<td>16<&#47;td></p>
<td>19<&#47;td></p>
<td>27<&#47;td><br />
<&#47;tr><br />
<&#47;tbody><br />
<&#47;table><br />
<&#47;div><br />
The results show that the <em>IQueryable.All()<&#47;em> method is not the best option for any of the scenarios tested. Using <em>Any()<&#47;em> or <em>SingleOrDefault()<&#47;em> will provide much faster results using&nbsp;less time in either case. Clearly the time difference is accentuated when comparing the <em>worst case<&#47;em> results.</p>
<p>If you take a look at the SQL code generated from the <em>IQueryable.All()<&#47;em> and <em>IQueryable.Any()<&#47;em>&nbsp;methods&nbsp;you can immediately notice the difference between them. For my specific scenario, using <em>All()&nbsp;<&#47;em>was the incorrect choice from the beginning...the logic should have been written with <em>Any().<&#47;em></p>
<pre class="striped:false lang:tsql mark:7-15,24-25 decode:true ">DECLARE @Id INT;<br />
SET @Id = 0;</p>
<p>--IQueryable.All()<br />
SELECT<br />
   CASE<br />
      WHEN (NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 AS [C1] FROM Customer<br />
         WHERE (CustomerID = @Id)<br />
         OR<br />
         (CASE<br />
            WHEN (CustomerID <> @Id)<br />
               THEN cast(1 as bit)<br />
            WHEN (CustomerID = @Id)<br />
               THEN cast(0 as bit)<br />
         END IS NULL)))<br />
      THEN cast(1 as bit)<br />
      ELSE cast(0 as bit)<br />
   END AS [C1]<br />
FROM ( SELECT 1 AS X ) AS [SingleRowTable1]</p>
<p>--IQueryable.Any()<br />
SELECT<br />
   CASE<br />
      WHEN (EXISTS (SELECT 1 AS [C1] FROM Customer<br />
         WHERE CustomerID = @Id))<br />
      THEN cast(1 as bit)<br />
      ELSE cast(0 as bit)<br />
   END AS [C1]<br />
FROM ( SELECT 1 AS X ) AS [SingleRowTable1]<&#47;pre><br />
There will be some specific cases in which <em>IQueryable.All()<&#47;em>&nbsp;must be used in order to verify a condition on all the elements of a sequence. It important to recognize these situations and plan accordingly, in order to minimize the impact of this call on the performance of an application.</p>
