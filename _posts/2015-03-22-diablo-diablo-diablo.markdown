I purchased Diablo 3 almost two years after the original release date. I bought it right when Blizzard was running a 50% discount on the price, so at 20€ it was the perfect time to get back to point-and-clicking like it was the year 2000.

I was really looking forward to playing the game, but my original enthusiasm died down when I realized that I needed to pay 60€ in order to play an online-only game. So I decided to wait until it got cheaper.

Let's start with the things I did not like. There were two specific aspects of the game where I was very disappointed with the decisions made by Blizzard.

**[SPOILERS AHEAD]**

Like the story...it is bad, very bad. The way the story was presented throughout the game felt rushed and everything related to it seemed out of place. Especially in regards to Leah...she never really developed as a character in the story, which would have been helpful, considering how central she is to everything.

Not everything is a let down, Cain's exit is a nice moment, as well as Diablo's arrival to Heaven. However, both the heroes and the villains in this game seem like a group of squabbling children instead of characters that are deciding the fate of humans, angels, and demons. There is no real sense of being part of an epic quest.

The decision to have an always-online single player campaign is questionable. For anyone that enjoys going through the campaign solo (me!) this decision has no benefits. While I can understand the desire to prevent piracy, or to stop cheating players in the PvE online modes, in the end this requirement hurts paying customers.

I can only imagine the rage that could come from losing a character in hardcore mode due to a dropped connection. I believe there's no reason for a solo campaign to be tied to your online connection, even more so after seeing that the console versions of the game do not have this limitation.

The good thing about these flaws is that the can be largely ignored and they do not detract from the gameplay. I have never suffered from lag issues while connected to Battle.net and after some time it is easy to ignore the dialogue between characters.

On the good side, I really enjoyed the rest of Diablo 3, especially its combat mechanics. I completed the campaign plus the expansion with two different classes (Monk / Wizard) and the skills available for both were quite varied. This diversity goes a long way to encourage the player to test different combinations to find which are the best for their playing style.

The cooldowns for skills and potions are a welcome addition to the game, as it prevents spamming. The automatic Town Portal is pretty useful, too.

After finishing the campaign twice with two different characters, I can safely write that truly believe that Diablo 3 is a great game on its own merit, even though its predecessor's shadow looms large over it. True, Diablo 3 is not perfect, but it is without a doubt a highly entertaining game.

I do not feel that it provides the same lasting appeal as Diablo 2, but that's ok. I had a lot fun going back to Sanctuary after such a long time, and I will probably return for a third playthrough. And if you have not, then you should.
