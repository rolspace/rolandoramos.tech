It's been about three months since my first class. I was not really sure what to expect, since the general opinion is that German is a really tough language to learn.

At this point I can proudly say that I have learned a few things and I am probably able to say a phrase or two. I can pick up the meaning of a few advertisement posters in the street, and I can figure out the meaning of a few newspaper headlines.

The big trouble comes when trying to listen to German out in the street (especially so in Zurich), that's tough, so "<em>Ich brauche mehr zuh&ouml;ren"</em> I guess.

Learning is always an fun activity, though learning a new language isn't easy. The main problem is finding time to practice and learn new words. Where did all the time I used to have go? :S

Sooner or later I will need to find a conversation group or something similar. My class is pretty good and I am learning a lot, but without practice it will be difficult to make any significant strides. Though so far so gut.
