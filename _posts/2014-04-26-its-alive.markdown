Finally! The first post in my blog is written. This project has gone through some rough times in the past year, to the point that it was almost left for dead a couple of times.

Fortunately, things are moving in the right direction and I believe that the initial version of the website will be released in about a month (`or two`).

So, this is not the first <em>official</em> post of the website, since I am the only one able to see it. There are a lot of style changes that need to be made before I can officially release the website, but I feel that writing this post is a good way to get things closer to the finish line. Just a little more to go!
