<p>It has been 113 days since the move to Z&uuml;rich.</p>
<p>Now that some time has passed and things have calmed down a bit I feel somewhat&nbsp;attached to this&nbsp;city, though I cannot give an exact explanation&nbsp;for this. In a way Zurich seems like the type of place that I would not like: small,&nbsp;and quiet. Maybe too quiet.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-73"></a>I am sure that&nbsp;part of this <em>attachment&nbsp;<&#47;em>is related&nbsp;to everything you have to learn once you start living here. When you come here, you have to know that you will make a significant time investment getting used to the Swiss way, especially if you do not speak German.</p>
<p>There's lots of paperwork to do at first, looking for&nbsp;a place to live is difficult, shops are closed on Sundays, and the German language sounds&nbsp;completely alien to me right now. (<em>I attended my 4th class this week!)<&#47;em></p>
<p>It might seem a bit daunting at first, but once you know how everything is organized it all makes sense...<em>well, most of it, you DO need to learn a bit of German<&#47;em>. Fortunately, everyone that I have spoken to has been very helpful and polite, even though I barely speak a word of their native tongue.</p>
<p>Most of the people I know have said&nbsp;that summer is great a time to be in Zurich, however, we are in the first week of July and summer isn't really here yet, it has been raining quite a lot. Here's hoping the weather turns and we get lots of sunny days.</p>
