Bravely Default was first released in Japan in October 2012. Soon after its release (or even before) it received a lot of coverage from Western gaming media. Due to this, it was easy to find information about the game online. Some time after its release in Japan, it was announced that the game would be localized and released in western markets, to the joy of RPG fans everywhere.

It had been a while since I had the time available to play a 40+ hour RPG, so Bravely Default caught my attention as the time drew near for its western release. I decided to go against my nature and buy it on release date, taking a chance on all the positive comments and reviews coming from Japan.

Not too long ago I finally finished the game, and I feel...relieved. Bravely Default was definitely a good game, but I believe that its one major flaw is extremely hard to overlook. It is a game that is easy to enjoy, however, there is a moment when it will test your patience and willingness to go all the way to the end.

The game starts as one of its protagonists, Tiz Arrior, wakes up in the town of {town name} after a giant chasm appeared and destroyed his home village, Norende. Tiz is the only survivor from the disaster, and he journeys to the chasm hoping to find his brother. There, he find Agnes Oblige, the Vestal of Wind, trying to find clues to explain the disaster. Together, they decide to travel together, in order to awaken the four crystals so that the damage from the chasm can be repaired.

For the most part, the story does a good job in advancing the game from one location to another, while letting the characters gain experience and Jobs during the quests. Unfortunately, there is a specific point in the story that changes the way the game progresses, and it forces the player to run through the same cycle 5 different times.

This is by far the biggest flaw in Bravely Default. In order to achieve the True Ending, the player must awaken all 4 Crystals in 5 alternate worlds, essentially having to fight the same battles each time. 

The battle system in Bravely Default is somewhat different from your typical turn based RPG. During a turn, the player can select to either <em>Brave</em> or <em>Default</em> for a character in the battle. If you select Brave you use BP (battle points) and the character will unleash multiple attacks (max 4) on the enemy. If you select Default, then the character will store 1 BP for the next turn and defend from any enemy attacks.

Joining this feature with the abilities provided by the game's job system, gives players the option to use different approaches in enemy encounters. The jobs available in the game are quite diverse and most of them have at least one skill that can be helful in a character's abilities setup.

One of the best things about Bravely Default is the soundtrack. I never got tired of hearing the music in this game, I definitely need to get my hands on the soundtrack at some point. Even if you don't enjoy the game that much, the music will keep you in it.

For the most part I feel that the design and graphics were the right style choice for the game. The one minor complaint I have here is that it was a bit strange to see the characters wearing the job costumes during cutscenes. The 3D effect works really well in Bravely Default, never turn it off.

And finally, the one I believe is the best feature in the game: the ability to increase decrease the game's difficulty and or to turn off enemy encounters. This is extremely useful, especially for older gamers like myself. Now that I have used this, it will be very hard to play an RPG without something similar, for me, it changes the whole experience. Random encounters are the devil!

Now, onto the bad things...

**[SPOILERS AHEAD]**

The game has a pacing problem. Everything seems fine until you reach a specific point in the story, and then, it seems like you got your own Norende sized hole to deal with.
After finally beating the game I could not help but wonder why this decision was made. Why would the people who made the game decide that you had to repeat a specific section of the game four times (was it four or five?). In fact, that's not really the problem. The problem is that the repetition is boring. For me, it almost killed the game.
By Chapter 6 I was saying to myself: <em>"This has got to be the last time, right? Right??"</em> And then there were <em>two</em> more go-rounds.

Unfortunately, this game is not going to win any RPG of the Decade awards, and one specific design choice turned what had been really fun game into a hassle I am not planning to repeat. I'm glad it's over.

**[END SPOILERS]**

In the end, Bravely Default does a lot of things right, and it is one of the best games available for the 3DS. I say that if you have time to spare, then go ahead and play it, especially now that it should be a bit cheaper. It has one glaring flaw that drags down the last part of the game, but as a whole, Bravely Default is a good gaming experience.
