Bravely Default was first released in Japan in October 2012. In the time leading up to the game's release, it received a lot of coverage from Western gaming media. Because to this, it was easy to find information about the game online. Some time after its release in Japan, it was announced that the game would be localized and released in western markets, to the joy of RPG fans everywhere.

It had been a while since I had the time to play a 40+ hour RPG, so Bravely Default caught my attention as the time drew near for its western release. I decided to go against my nature and buy it on release date, taking a chance on all the positive comments and reviews coming from Japan.

Not long ago, I finally finished the game, and I feel...relieved. Bravely Default was definitely a good game, but I think that its one major flaw is very hard to overlook. It is a game that is easy to enjoy, however, there is a moment when it will test your patience and willingness to go all the way to the end...but more on this later.

The game starts as one of its protagonists, Tiz Arrior, wakes up in the city of Caldisla, a week after a giant chasm suddenly appeared and destroyed his home village, Norende. Tiz is the only survivor from the disaster and he decides to return to the chasm hoping to find his brother. There, he finds Agnès Oblige, the Vestal of Wind, who is accompanied by a fairy, named Airy. Agnès wishes to free the Wind Crystal from the darkness that has surrounded it, and in doing so, undo the damage caused to the land.

This is where the main quest begins, as you begin your journey with Tiz and Agnès in order to find a way to heal the land of Luxendarc. For the most part, the story does a good job of advancing the game from one location to another, while uncovering the story and all the hidden plots surrounding the 4 Crystals (Water, Fire, Wind, and Earth).

As your quest progresses, two more characters will join you party, Edea Lee and Ringabel. Edea is a member of the Sky Knights, dispatched from the Kingdom of Eternia, to capture Agnés. She decides to switch her allegiance when confronted with the atrocities committed by her allies. Ringabel has no memories and nowhere to go, however, he possesses a book which seems to predict the future called D's Journal. Together, these 4 characters join forces to free the 4 Crystals from the darkness that engulfs them.

The battle system in Bravely Default is somewhat different from your typical turn based RPG. On every battle, on each character's turn, the player must choose first between two actions: <i>Brave</i> or <i>Default</i>. If you choose <i>Default</i>, the character will defend, and accumulate one <i>Brave Point</i> to be used in a another turn. If you choose <i>Brave</i> the character will perform an action (Attack, Magic, Item, etc).

Selecting <i>Brave</i> consumes <i>Brave Points</i>. If you have a positive number of <i>Brave Points</i> you are able to consume up to four <i>BP</i>. If the player decides to use the 4 available <i>Brave Points</i> and the character has not saved up enough <i>Defaults</i>, then that character will end up with negative point. This means the selected character will be inactive during the turn and will be vulnerable to damage.

In addition to using <i>Braves</i> or <i>Defaults</i> during battle, the characters can choose from various jobs obtained during the game. These jobs really make the game come together during enemy encounters and boss battles. They bring a lot of variety to combat and will present the player with many options to choose from.

Each of the characters can be assigned a Job, which provide the character with a variety of stat modifications and skills in line with the job's purpose. For example, the White Mage Job applies a 30% increase to the MP and MND stats, and a 20% increase to the INT stat. At the same time it decreases the DEX stat by 20%, the STR stat by 30%, and the VIT stat by 40%. Also, each Job applies a letter-based stat modifier to different types of equipment (Sword, Shield, etc). The equipment stat modifiers are: S, A, B, C, D, E; S is the highest modified available (100% stat boots), while E is the lowest (No stat boost).

There are a total of 24 unique Jobs in the game. You can obtain a new Job by defeating specific bosses in the game. It must be noted that not all the Jobs are available just by following the story, some of them need to be obtained by completing sidequests. Just as characters level up with Experience Points, each Job can gain higher levels with Job Points, up to level 14. As the Job level increases, there will be new abilities available. 

Jobs can be combined in interesting ways thanks to the Ability setup in the menu. Once a character is given a Job, additional abilities can be assigned through the Job Command and the Support Abilities options. Using the Job Command option in the menu, you can set an additional group of abilities from a different Job than the one the character is assigned. The Support Abilities option allows you to pick an choose specific skills from various Jobs for your character. There are many combinations available, which really open up options available to you during battle.

One of the best things about Bravely Default is the soundtrack. I  need to get my hands on the game's music at some point, it was that good. Even if you don't enjoy the game that much, the music will keep you in it.

In regards to the game's art direction, I feel that the style choice was the right decision for this game. All the elements fit well together: character models, weapons, world map, etc. All these elements seem to have a nostalgic quality, giving the impression that you have been here before. For me, the Chibi character style doesn't detract from the game, but it seems at odds with the versions of the characters you see in the game's initial cutscenes. The one real complaint I have about the character models, is that it was a bit strange to see the characters wearing the Job costumes during cutscenes.

Last, but not least, what I believe are the two best features in the game: 1) the ability to increase/decrease the game's difficulty and 2) the ability to turn enemy encounters on/off. This is extremely useful, especially for older gamers like myself. Now that I have used this, it will be very hard to play any other RPG without something similar, for me, it changes the whole experience. Random encounters are the devil!

Unfortunately, Bravely Default is not perfect. It has a pacing problem...a major pacing problem. Everything seems fine until you reach a specific point in the story, and then, like Tiz, you got your own Norende sized hole to deal with. 

If want to get the game's True Ending (and you do, because the Bad Ending is unsatisfying), you have to deal with the fact that you will need to repeat the quest...5 times, yes, 5 more times. Of course, this doesn't mean that you have play the entire game 5 more times, but you will need to awaken each Crystal 5 additional times, boss battles included. In order to achieve the True Ending, you must awaken all 4 Crystals in 5 alternate worlds, essentially having to fight the same battles each time. 

To me, this is the biggest flaw in Bravely Default. After beating the game I could not help but wonder why this decision was made. For me, it almost killed the game, I was very close to just forgetting about it a few times, but I was already too invested in the characters to simply let it. By Chapter 6 I was saying to myself: <em>"This has got to be the last time, right?"</em> And then there were <em>two</em> more. The game had been fantastic up the point where repetition made it a complete drag.

In the end, Bravely Default does a lot of things right, and it is one of the best games available for the 3DS. If you have time to spare, then, go ahead and play it. The game has a good story and a great cast of characters, the battle system gives you a lot of choices, and the music is stunning. It has one glaring flaw that drags down the last part of the game, but as a whole, Bravely Default is an enjoyable gaming experience.
