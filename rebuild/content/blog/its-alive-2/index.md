After quite a bit of time, this blog is finally rebuilt. You will not notice any changes, because it looks the same, but it's not.

This site was initially launched using Wordpress, but soon after I realized I was not happy with the platform. I spent a few weeks taking a long look at the alternatives, and in the end, I decided to go with Jekyll. I am very happy about my choice. Rebuilding the website took a bit longer than I hope, but now that it is done, I think that the process of writing and managing the code is a lot easier for me now.

Wordpress provides a lot of nice features and extensions to power websites, but I felt I needed something different. I quickly got tired of the plugin system, the theming, and being at the mercy of an application I did not fully control.

Now that this part is done, I hope to have enough time to give a new look to the website sometime in 2017!
