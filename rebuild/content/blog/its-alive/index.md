Finally! The first post in my blog is written. This project has gone through some rough times in the past year, up to the point that it was almost left for dead a couple of times.

Fortunately, things are moving in the right direction and I believe that the initial version of the website will be released in about a month (or two).

This is not the first <em>official</em> post, since I am the only one able to see it. There are a lot of style changes that need to be made before I can officially release the website, but I feel that writing this is a good way to get things closer to the finish line. Just a little more to go!
