It has been 113 days since I moved to Z&uuml;rich.

Now that some time has passed and things have calmed down a bit, I feel somewhat attached to this city, though I cannot give an exact explanation for this. In a way Z&uuml;rich seems like the exact type of place that I would dislike: small and quiet.

I am sure that part of this <em>attachment</em> is related to everything you have to learn once you start living here. When you come here, you have to know that you will make a significant time investment getting used to the Swiss way, especially if you do not speak German.

There's lots of paperwork to do at first, looking for a place to live is difficult, shops are closed on Sundays, and the German language sounds completely alien to me right now.

It might seem a bit daunting at first, but once you know how everything is organized it all makes sense...<em>well, most of it</em>. Fortunately, everyone that I have spoken to has been very helpful and polite, even though I barely speak a word of German (or Swiss German).

Most of the people I know have said that summer is great a time to be in Zurich, however, we are in the first week of July and summer isn't really here yet, it has been raining quite a lot. Here's hoping the weather turns and we get lots of sunny days.
