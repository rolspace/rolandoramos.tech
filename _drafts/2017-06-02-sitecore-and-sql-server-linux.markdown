A few weeks ago I ran into a problem with my work computer. For some reason I could not install SQL Server Express, or any other version. I kept getting an error about some internal service not being installed correctly. I spent some time trying to find a solution, but I could not come up with any answers.

I decided to try something else, so I attempted to get the MSSQL Server Docker image running on my computer. Unfortunately, that did not work either. I followed the setup instructions provided, checked the Docker logs, and I did as much Google research as I could to get it working.

I wanted to setup a SQL Server instance in order to install Sitecore 8.2 on my machine, and I was running out of options.
