It has been over a year since I became a team manager for the first time in my career. I have to admit it is something I always wanted to do, and I very glad it happened.

For me it has been an extremely rewarding experience, and I am painfully aware that I have made a few mistakes since my role changed. Fortunately, I believe that the path to improvement lies in looking back and recognizing those areas where you can improve.

I know I do not have a lot of experience yet, but I think I can share a few of the tips that have helped me ease the transition from software engineer to team manager. In no particular order:

1. Listen
Such a simple concept, but it is so easy to underestimate the value of listening. Especially if these people are in your team. No matter the years of experience or the eloquence, it is important to listen to other's opinions and concerns. There is no easier way to get to know a person. 

By encouraging people to speak their opinions and listening to these opinions, everyone in the team will grow to trust each other more and more. Also, the team will have a chance to benefit from ideas that come from someone other than you, the manager.

There are a few articles which I found to be very helpful:
