It has been almost a year and a half since I became a team manager for the first time in my career. I have to admit this is something I always wanted to do, but once it happened I realized that there were many things I did not know...far more than I had expected. I needed to approach this a lot differently from my previous position as Technical Lead.

For me, it has been an extremely rewarding experience, and I am painfully aware that I have made a few mistakes since then. Nevertheless, it is true that the path to improvement lies in looking back and recognizing those areas where you can adjust.

I know I do not have a lot of experience yet, but I think I can share a few of the things that have helped me ease the transition from software engineer to team manager. In no particular order:

1. Listen
Such a simple concept, yet it is very easy to underestimate the value of listening. No matter the years of experience or how eloquent someone is, it is important to truly listen to others' opinions and concerns. There is no easier way to get to know a person. There is no easier way for people to trust each other.

By encouraging people to voice their opinions and listening to them, it will become a habit within the team as time passes. When new people join the team, seeing this behavior will allow them to feel at ease much quicker in a new environment. They will know they have come to a place where others will listen.

2. Read and learn as much as you can
There is a vast amount of information on the topics of management, organization, and leadership. It would be a waste not to take advantage and use it to be the best manager you can.

Of course, not everything you read will apply to your situation. Try to identify which pieces of advice will give you the best return for your team. If you are a new manager, there are some of the aspects of a manager's role that you will be unprepared for: going through performance reviews, how to motivate others, dealing with salary negotiations, speaking to an underachieving team member, etc. It will be better to find  first-hard experiences from others who have been in a similar situation.

There are many sources to look for insight and opinions, some of my current favorites are: [https://hbr.org/][The Hardvard Business Review], [https://www.linkedin.com][LinkedIn], and [https://medium.com][Medium].

3. Set expectations and goals
This is an important part of a team's path to success. Every team should know what is expected of it and what its goals are.

Most people know that everyone should be treated with respect, they should be on time, etc, but establishing these expectations verbally (and in writing) in front of all team members will increase the team's commitment in meeting these expectations.

In the same way, when you setup short-term and long-term goals, the team will know that you are invested in guiding them to achieve these goals. These goals need to be defined for the team as a whole and for individual team members as well.

These goals need to be challenging, but they also need to be attainable. It is also important that you can support the people in your team as a coach and mentor. Your team members will need help from you to find the time and motivation to reach them.

4. Maximize the strenghts of the team
If you are able to recognize each team member´s strenghts, then you will be better equipped to help them become more valuable to the team. By playing for a team member´s best qualities, you are recognizing that person´s skills and giving them the opportunity to excel at what they do best.

In regards to this, it is important to avoid letting team members stay too long in their comfort zone, there need to be challenges for them to hone their skills and test their limits.

5. Don't be afraid of weaknesses

Even your own. It is important to recognize that we all have skills and abilities which we haven't fully developed, either through lack of training or adequate opportunities.

After identifying these areas for improvement, have an open conversation with the team member to determine if they feel the same way about these "weaknesses" you have identified. It is very possible that they have a different opinion about themselves. We should listen and understand their version of the story.

In the end, you will come to a conclusion together, about what should be done to make these improvements happen. At the same time, the bond of trust within the team will be stronger.
