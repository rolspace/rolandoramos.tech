One of the most difficult things I have had to do during my time as a manager is to hire people.

As I soon found out, there has been a lot written about the topic of hiring and the reasons why it is a hard. Many people who become managers (like me) are totally unprepared to go through the process of identifying and hiring the best candidates for a position.

I used to think that for Software Engineering positions things were a lot easier, considering that you can always gauge someone's technical ability through an assessment or a coding test. Now, my opinion is very different, but we will get to that in a few paragraphs.

After reading many different articles and having multiple conversations with colleagues and friends, I came to the conclusion that hiring Software Engineers is difficult because:

- There isn't a clear definition of the qualities and skills needed.
- There isn't a "right" way to determine technical ability.

These statements are not the ultimate truth when it comes to hiring Software Engineers. Of course, there must be other reasons that raise additional concerns, however, in my experience, these are the two crucial reasons that make this process particularly challenging.

No clear definition of the qualities and skills needed

When it comes to writing a job description for a new job opening, things get complicated quickly. A good job description should contain a listing of the core technical skills needed for a position. However, it is very easy to get lose your way by including additional languages, software, or tools  as "nice to haves".

In recent years, the amount of software, libraries, and tools that developers have at their disposal has grown exponentially. Because of this, it is very easy to find job postings that are completely filled with programming languages, acronyms, tools, etc, without focusing on the core technical skills that are needed for a role.

My recommendation is that hiring managers looking for new team members need to give the proper amount of attention to the job postings that are advertised. A well written job posting will attract a lot of candidates to be sure, but it will also attract adequate candidates, especially if the core skills for the position are clearly defined.

No "right" way to determine technical ability

In order to hire Software Engineers, it becomes necessary to determine their technical ability. I have seen this done in a few different ways:

- Whiteboard testing
- In person assignments
- Take home assignments
- Technical Interviews

It is likely that there are a few more options aside from the ones I have listed.

And that's precisely the point.
