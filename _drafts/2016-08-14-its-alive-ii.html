After some time, this blog is finally rebuilt. I know, it looks the same, but it's not.

I was not happy about Wordpress and after taking a long look at the alternatives, I settled for Jekyll. I am very happy about my choice. Even though it has taken some time for the site to be fully rebuilt, I think that the entire process is a lot easier for me.

Wordpress provides a lot of nice features and extensions to power your blog, but after using it, I felt I needed something different. I got tired quite quickly of the plugin system, the theming, and being at the mercy of an application I did not fully control.

I hope to have enough time to give a new look to the website before the year is over.
