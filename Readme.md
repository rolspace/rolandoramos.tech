# rolandoramos.tech

This repository contains the code for my personal website. The current version of this website at [www.rolandoramos.tech](https://www.rolandoramos.tech) is built on Jekyll.

At the moment, the site is being rebuilt using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and, hopefully soon, a completely new version of the code will be released.

The code for the rebuild can be found in the /rebuild/ folder of this branch.
