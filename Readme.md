# rolandoramos.tech

This repository contains the code for my personal website. The current version of this website, available at [www.rolandoramos.tech](https://www.rolandoramos.tech), is generated using Jekyll.

At the moment, the site is being rebuilt with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and, hopefully soon, a completely new version of the code will be released to replace the old version.

The code for the rebuild can be found in the /rebuild/ folder of this branch.
