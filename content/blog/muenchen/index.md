My stay in Munich was a bit short, even so, the fact is that M&uuml;nich is a GREAT place to visit. The weather was right, the food was fantastic, and the beers were cold.

The one place I liked the most during my visit was definitely <em>Viktualienmarkt.</em> The market is a great place to sit down, have a drink, and spend some time just being there, especially on a sunny day.

Having said that, I am kind of glad it rained during one of the afternoons I was there, or else I would not have had the chance to check out the <em>Lenbachhaus</em>. There is some really good artwork there and you can easily spend 2-3 (or more) hours walking through the museum.

And DO NOT miss the views from St. Peter&acute;s. Be warned though, the walk up the tower takes a bit of time, and it will probably be a bit cramped.

I am definitely going back to Munich.
