It's been a looooooooong time...but now it's back.

The first version of this website was built as a Wordpress blog. It didn't take very long for me to realize that it was overkill and Wordpress made things unnecessarily complicated. I spent quite some time with research, until I came to the conclusion that Jekyll was a much better alternative to generate the content necessary for a personal blog.

Jekyll has worked well for me, though I felt that in order to create an SPA website with an engine like Angular or React, I needed to change direction. That's how I settled on Gatsby as the new platform to generate the website content. I know I know, the site looks almost exactly the same...but at the same time it is not. Maybe sometime down the road I will think of changing the look of things, too.

As the new year will begin soon, I expect to be more involved in writing content here. It's been too long.
