After three years of managing and leading a technical team, I hit a point where I began to doubt whether I had made the right decision. As time went on, my 'managerial' responsibilities left me with very little time to pay attention to the technical challenges my team was facing. This had a negative effect on my motivation, since I felt my work did not have a real impact.

I always wanted to have the responsibility to manage a team, even if it came from an unfounded belief that I would be good at it (ooops). Once I actually became I manager, I needed to learn how to be a manager, while trying to be a manager. This meant that the tech side of things had to take a back seat.

Behaving as a leader for your team, running effective meetings, giving honest feedback, recognizing team members for their work, improving team efficiency, and doing performance reviews are just a few of the things that I needed to learn once my role changed. This was not easy for me, and I am guessing it is not easy for most people. It takes time and patience...and learning from your mistakes.

Initially, I really enjoyed my work as a manager, but after a couple of years, I was a little drained. My responsibilities took over all my time, which left no opportunities for doing any hands-on work. I started to feel that the knowledge which had helped me to a promotion was being taken from me. Over time, I finally got it...I learned that if you are responsible for people, it is your duty to guarantee that they are comfortable, that they learn, that they grow, and that they can succeed.

So...how do you manage to be responsible for the people in your team and at the same time, stay relevant from a technical standpoint?

It took me some time to properly answer this question for myself. I believe that in my case, when I took over a management role I did not really take the time to fully understand what was being asked of me. For people that move from a technical, hands-on role to a management position, it is extremely important to know the answers to some of these questions:

- what is the status of the team? is the team performing well?
- has anyone joined recently? has anyone left recently? why?
- how many people will you manage? is there a tech lead? or leads?
- what is your role in hiring? will you have to screen candidate resumes? can you work with recruiters?
- what is your role in planning? is there a clearly defined agile process in place?

These are not all the questions you could ask, but some of the answers will tell you if you have a structure in place to support your growth as a technical manager.

It is important to realize that your focus needs to change. You will need to take a step back from the day to day details and you will definitely not have much to time for hands-on coding. On the other hand, there will be many opportunities to experience software engineering from a completely different point of view.

One of the main aspects of a tech management role is that you must work with your team to make decisions about software design and to discuss key aspects of the implementation...without jumping in to do it yourself. If you want to be effective as a manager, it is important that you have a strong technical understanding of the solution, service, or product that the team is responsible for. This will help you build a culture of teamwork and mentoring, where you can lead by example as you support the team on a day to day basis.

So how do you keep yourself technically relevant? Find time...there are no shortcuts.

Why is it important to remain technically relevant?

One of my favorite books on software engineering is [Code Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete). Even though the book is a bit long, it has tons of practical advice on software construction. Some of my favorite parts in the book are the ones where the author, Steve McConnell, writes about the non-technical aspects of creating software, like management:

> "In software development, nontechnical managers are common, as are managers who have technical experience but who are 10 years behind the times. Technically competent, technically current managers are rare. If you work for one, do whatever you can to keep your job. It's an unusual treat."

It's unfortunate that there is no data to support the claims in the quote, but from my experience, I know that people really appreciate a manager who understands how things work and how difficult it is to make them work. That is why it is important for me to stay technically relevant, because I want to help my team.
