<h2 class="page-title">Welcome!</h2>

<div class="page-content">
<p>My name is Rolando, and this is my website. It took a lot longer than expected, and it is finally done (though it will never be 100% done). There are a few more things I want to add here, but as a 1.0 version of the website, I feel very good about it.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Panama City, Panama where I lived for most of my life. However, it's been about 10 years since I last resided in my homeland. Previously, I lived for four years in Searcy, Arkansas as I was attending college at <a title="Computer Science Honor Grads" href="https://www.harding.edu/comp/awards_honorgrads" target="_blank">Harding University</a>, where I got my degree in Computer Science. In 2005, I moved to Madrid, Spain, expecting to stay for about a year and ended up staying for 8, now it is my second home.</p>

<p>Currently I live in Z&uuml;rich. Even I have been here for over 2 years, I am still getting used to it, but I am definitely having a great time here.</p>

<p>I have been a software engineer for 8+ years, designing technical solutions and developing applications with Microsoft products. Even though software development takes up most of my time, I dedicate myself to learn as much as possible about technology and life.</p>

<p>You can also find me on <a href="http://ch.linkedin.com/in/rolandoramosrestrepo">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/rolspace">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+RolandoRamosRestrepo/about">Google+</a>. If you get in touch, I'll be sure to answer as quickly as I can.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
