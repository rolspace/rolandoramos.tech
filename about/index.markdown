<h2 class="article-title">Welcome!</h2>

<p>I am Rolando Ramos and this is my website. I write occasionally about software development, team management, and video games. Every once in a while I get lucky and take a nice photo, I will post some of those here.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Panama City, Panama, where I lived for most of my life. In 2003 I obtained my degree in Computer Science from <a title="Computer Science Honor Grads" href="https://www.harding.edu/comp/awards_honorgrads" target="_blank">Harding University</a>, in Searcy, Arkansas. After living in Madrid, Spain for 8 years and obtaining my MBA, I decided to move to Zurich, Switzerland.</p>

<p>I have been a software engineer for 8+ years. That is not just something I do for work, as I like to spend some of my free time with more code!</p>

<p>You can find me on <a href="http://ch.linkedin.com/in/rolandoramosrestrepo">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/rolspace">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+RolandoRamosRestrepo/about">Google+</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
