<h2 class="page-title">Welcome!</h2>

<div class="page-content">
	<p>I am Rolando Ramos and this is my website. I write occasionally about software development, team management, and video games. Every once in a while I get lucky and take a nice photo, I will post some of those here.</p>

	<p><img class="img-responsive lazyload about" src="/assets/about/me.jpg" alt="Rolando" /></p>

	<p>I was born and raised in Panama City, Panama, where I lived for most of my life. In 2003, I obtained my degree in Computer Science from <a title="Computer Science Honor Grads" href="https://www.harding.edu/comp/awards_honorgrads" target="_blank">Harding University</a>, in Searcy, Arkansas.</p>

	<p>After returning to Panama for a couple of years, I left again...this time to Madrid, Spain. There, I obtained an MBA, got married, and lived quite happily for 8 years. In 2014, my wife and I moved to Zurich, Switzerland and life is great.</p>

	<p>I have been a software engineer for 9+ years. This is not something I do just for work, as I like to spend some of my free time with more code!</p>

	<p>You can find me on <a href="http://ch.linkedin.com/in/rolandoramosrestrepo">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/rolspace">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+RolandoRamosRestrepo/about">Google+</a>.</p>

	<p>Enjoy!</p>
