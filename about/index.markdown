<h2>Welcome!</h2>

My name is Rolando, and I am the one responsible for this website. It took a lot longer than expected, and it's finally done (though it will never be 100% done). There are a few more things I want to add here, but as a 1.0 version of the website, I feel very good about it.

I was born and raised in Panama City, Panama where I lived for most of my life. However, it's been about 9 years since I last resided in my homeland. Previously, I lived for four years in Searcy, Arkansas when I was attending college at <a title="Computer Science Honor Grads" href="https://www.harding.edu/comp/awards_honorgrads" target="_blank">Harding University</a>, where I got my degree in Computer Science. In 2005, I moved to Madrid, Spain, expecting to stay for about a year and ended up staying for 8, now I call it my second home.

Currently I reside in Z&uuml;rich, which is a great place to be. Still getting used to it, but I am definitely having a good time here.

I have been a software engineer for 8+ years, designing technical solutions and developing applications with Microsoft products. Even though .NET takes up most of my time, I dedicate myself to learn...to learn as much as possible about technology and life.

You can also find me on <a href="http://ch.linkedin.com/in/rolandoramosrestrepo">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://instagram.com/rolspace">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+RolandoRamosRestrepo/about">Google+</a>. If you get in touch, I'll be sure to answer as quickly as I can.

Enjoy!
