<p>My name is Rolando, and I am the one responsible for this website. It took a lot longer than expected, and it's finally done (though it will never be 100% done). There are a few more things I want to add here, but as a 1.0 version of the website, I feel very good about it.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Panama City, Panama where&nbsp;I lived for most of my life. However, it's been about 9 years since I last resided in my homeland. Previously, I lived for four years&nbsp;in&nbsp;Searcy, Arkansas&nbsp;when&nbsp;I was&nbsp;attending <a title="Computer Science Honor Grads" href="https:&#47;&#47;www.harding.edu&#47;comp&#47;awards_honorgrads" target="_blank">college<&#47;a>&nbsp;at Harding University, where I got my degree in Computer Science. In&nbsp;2005, I moved to Madrid, Spain, expecting to stay for about a year and ended up staying for 8, now&nbsp;I call it my second home.</p>
<p>Currently&nbsp;I reside in Z&uuml;rich, which&nbsp;is a great place to be. Still getting used to it, but I am definitely having a good time here.</p>
<p>I have been a web developer for 7+ years, designing technical solutions and developing applications with Microsoft products. Even though .NET takes up most of my time, I dedicate myself to learn...to learn as much as possible about technology and life.</p>
<p>You can also find me on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ch.linkedin.com&#47;in&#47;rolandoramosrestrepo">LinkedIn<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;instagram.com&#47;rolspace">Instagram<&#47;a>, and <a href="https:&#47;&#47;plus.google.com&#47;u&#47;0&#47;+RolandoRamosRestrepo&#47;about">Google+<&#47;a>. If you get in touch,&nbsp;I'll be sure to answer as quickly as I can.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
